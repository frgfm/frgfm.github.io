    "text": "Main laptop components\nThe following concepts are very important as they define how you will experience your laptop (taking ages to open a single file üê¢ vs.¬†feeling like your laptop is always waiting on you üòé).\n\nMemory\nFor computers, we distinguish storage (things that remain saved even after shutting down your laptop) from RAM (information currently being used by your computer to perform a task at a given moment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRAM stands for Random Access Memory, but the French name is more self-explanatory ‚Äòm√©moire vive‚Äô which translates to ‚Äòquick/vivacious memory‚Äô.\n\n\n\nStorage\nThe information is written in this device so that when powered off, the data prevails. When using your file explorer, the files that you see are located on your storage device.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare storage options, consider their:\n\nstorage capacity: a few hundreds of gigabytes (Gb) in 2022.\nstorage type: HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or the faster but more expensive SSD (Solid State Drive).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDD vs.¬†SSD\n\n\n\n\n\nHDD are spinning disks, similar to vinyl record/CD, with two layers: a ferromagnetic layer, where data is stored, and a protective layer. The data interactions are performed by a read/write head (actuator arm), by leveraging the relation between electric current and local magnetic field.\nSSDs don‚Äôt have any disk, and each byte of information is written on MOS transistors. Thanks to the general trend of transistor density in manufacturing (cf.¬†Moore law), we can now fit quite a lot of those on an integrated circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragmentation of a HDD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a HDD and data reading is starting to get slower, you might be experiencing fragmentation. Files that have been repeatedly read or moved, might physically be in a suboptimal order on your physical disk. Since the rotation speed of the disk is limited, fragmentation increases the time needed to access a given file.\nYou should consider defragmenting it (using free software, no rocket science to do on your side).\n\n\n\n\n\nRAM\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely to storage, RAM is volatile: the data stored will be lost if it‚Äôs powered down. On a computer, you solicit the RAM as you open more web browser tabs or applications for instance. It is much faster than storage, but much more limited in terms of capacity (a few gigabytes up to a dozen in 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAM in-depth look\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two other technical indicators for RAM:\n\nRAM frequency: number of cycles per second (DDR4 RAM ranges from 1600 to 3600 MHz, while DDR5 ranges from 3200 to 6400 MHz).\nColumn Access Strobe Latency (CL): number of clock cycles it takes for the RAM to respond to a command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDual-channel memory\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your CPU needs to hold data, but your RAM capacity or frequency isn‚Äôt enough, it will start to use your storage device for this, which is much slower. Enters dual-channel memory to increase the transfer rate between the computer‚Äôs memory and the CPU. Instead of having a single channel 8Gb RAM connected to your motherboard & the CPU, having 2 4Gb RAM sticks will have the same RAM capacity as before but double the maximum speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing units\nAlright, we‚Äôre now into the core of a computer horsepower: its processing units!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\nEvery personal computers has a Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component has several physical cores, that can process information independently. The number of physical cores is however limited, so while it can perform multi-tasking, it‚Äôs optimized for sequential tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey specifications of a CPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber of cores & threads: as mentioned previously, the CPU is separated into several physical cores. Each core can have several threads, which are virtual subdivisions of each processing capacity.\nsingle-thread performance: how fast a single thread can perform operations.\nclock speed: the number of cycles executed by the CPU each second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt want to get into the specifics yourself? Fortunately there are multiple online benchmarks that compare CPUs for you, and provide an aggregate performance score that you can reliably use for your own comparison (e.g.¬†CPU Benchmark).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple and its specific hardware\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as operating systems go, gamers are restricted to Windows (generally speaking). But for the rest, is there any constraint? Most laptop manufacturers have similar or compatible hardware architectures, on which you can easily use Windows or Linux. But it‚Äôs a different story for Apple and its Mac laptops.\nYou might have heard but in November 2020, Apple announced its famous M1 chip, which is a CPU with a different architecture (based on the ARM architecture family). It promised a big leap in power efficiency and it delivered, but just like any new architecture, there is an adoption curve for software support. So if you go for this option, check that it‚Äôs compatible with your usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU\nA Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is optimized for parallel operations. In 3D rendering or gaming, the computer needs to perform computation for each pixel (position, texture, lighting, etc.). Each of those pixel computations is independent, in the sense, that two neighbouring pixels don‚Äôt need the RGB value of their neighbour to compute theirs.\nIf we leave it up to the CPU to do this, as mentioned, the task parallelisation is quite limited. While CPU cores are more powerful, a modern GPU has several thousands of weaker ones, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs well suited for this type of tasks üïπÔ∏è\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey specifications of a GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRAM: you now know that RAM is used for data transfer with the CPU, well VRAM is the same for the GPU. For gamers, as you push your graphics settings of a given game from ‚Äúminimal‚Äù to ‚Äúultra‚Äù, the GPU will need to load more refined textures and elements for each frame and thus need more VRAM.\nnumber of cores: I won‚Äôt get into too much details on this, because depending on the manufacturer and the generation, cores can have several types. They are analog to the physical cores of a CPU, but less powerful.\nTotal Graphics Power (TGP): the power required by the GPU to perform its tasks. A higher value will drain the battery faster, and conversely for the processing throughput.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it now has found many other purposes, the GPU was initially brought to market for video games and 3D rendering! Similarly to CPU, you can find multiple online benchmarks for GPU (e.g.¬†GPU User Benchmark) that will do the heavy lifting for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other lesser known siblings: TPU & IPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTPU: as deep learning grew bigger in the 2010s, people started looking at GPUs, which were designed for Gaming and 3D rendering, for their own purpose. In 2015, Google developed and started using internally Tensor Processing Units (TPU). Rather than repurposing something designed for video games, they worked on a chip for deep learning, and more generally speaking, tensor processing. You cannot purchase one, but you can experiment with it on Google Colab!\nIPU: the company called Graphcore has been developing another chip of their own, called an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), which has become gradually known in the machine learning community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen display\nFor your screen, there are three main aspects to consider: size, native resolution, refresh rate.\n\nScreen size\nDepending on your usage, you might have different preferences. Bigger screens are nicer for media and gaming, but the laptop becomes heavier. The current industry usually proposes 3 main options: 13‚Äô, 15‚Äô or 17‚Äô (number of inches along the diagonal of the display).\n\n\nNative resolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe native resolution is the number of pixels along each side of the display (that is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high for a Full-HD screen). As illustrated above, the market is nowadays dominated by FHD, QHD and UHD displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFHD vs.¬†UHD\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre using your laptop for media, and your movies are all in FHD (1080p), going for a laptop with QHD or UHD native resolution will cost you a lot more and won‚Äôt change anything to your viewing (it might even be worse because the video will be upsampled upon rendering). You get optimal results when your screen native resolution matches the resolution of the media you are watching, and that also applies to gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh rate\nAlright, what is the refresh rate now? It is the maximum number of times a pixel on your screen will change value per second. What does this mean? A low value like 60Hz might sometimes look like there is some flickering, while high values like 165Hz will look much smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatte vs.¬†glossy\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially, if you are using your laptop outside regularly, try to get a matte display. Otherwise the reflection might be disturbing in bright environments with a glossy display. Worth checking the difference over here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSum-up\nWith all this information, you deserve a quick recap!\n\n\n\n\n\nData read/write\n\nStorage: what you need to save more files on your computer. There are two types: HDD, and SSD. The latter is more expensive but faster. Whatever the type, the storage capacity ranges between 128Gb and several thousands of Gb.\nRAM: what you need to have more applications opened at the same time. The RAM capacity ranges from 4Gb to several dozens of Gb.\n\nData processing\n\nCPU: performs operations sequentially using the data stored in RAM, essential to your laptop whatever your usage. You can compare performances on websites such as CPU Benchmark.\nGPU: performs operations in parallel, not essential to your laptop (apart from gaming & other graphics intensive usages). You can compare performances on websites such as GPU User Benchmark.\n\nBuild quality\n\nscreen size: the physical size of your screen.\nnative resolution: the number of pixels on each side of your screen.\nrefresh rate: how many times per second each pixel value can change."

I‚Äôll distinguish 4 usage types and lay out how they translate in terms of comparison aspects:\n\nGaming: playing video games.\nMedia: Netflix & chill, web browsing.\nWorking: software development, presentations, spreadsheets, etc.\nGraphics-intensive: deep learning, 3D rendering, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can easily overlap several usage types: in my case, I have been doing deep learning for work.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for technical specifications?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\nKey aspects\nRecommended specs\n\n\n\n\nGaming\nperformance\nPowerful CPU & GPU, large RAM capacity, high screen refresh rate\n\n\nMedia\nautonomy, screen quality\nGood battery life, good screen refresh rate\n\n\nWorking\nperformance, weight, autonomy\nPowerful CPU, good RAM capacity, excellent battery life\n\n\nGraphics-intensive\nperformance, autonomy\nPowerful CPU & GPU, large RAM capacity, good battery life\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need a dedicated GPU?\nFor media and working usages, you can skip this section üëç\n\nGaming & 3D rendering\nIf you are the type of person who only tolerates ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù graphics settings, you should be aware that video games maximum settings have rapidly evolving hardware requirements. That means that you might need to update some components soon (you should be good for 2 years at least still). In that case, perhaps consider a desktop computer as your laptop will be have a limited number of components that you can replace üò¢\nIf you have a looser tolerance for graphics settings, or you simply want to be able to play in the train, don‚Äôt go for the most expensive GPU. You can find decently-powerful mobile GPUs at better price üòâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern GPU features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou care about graphics quality and frame rate, right? Whether you go for AMD Radeon or NVIDIA GeForce products, there are two modern features you should be chasing:\n\nRay tracing: the rendering is done by tracing the path of light and its interaction, instead of performing rasterization (converting 3D graphics into 2D pixels thanks to shaders).\nDLSS / FSR: the GPU will oversample the rendering (spatially and temporarily) using Deep Learning to boost the FPS.\n\nOn NVIDIA side, aim at least for RTX 20 series (RTX 2070 and up, or RTX 3060 and up). On AMD side, aim for 6 series (RX 6700 XT and up).\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning\nDoing deep learning does not necessarily mean that you need a GPU laptop! You can:\n\nuse a GPU desktop computer instead: either do everything on your desktop computer, or limit laptop tasks to the ones that don‚Äôt require a GPU.\nleverage Cloud GPU instances: don‚Äôt want to bother with hardware? Try Google Colab with free access to GPU, or explore more powerful paying options.\n\nFor both options, nor the data or the computing will be on your laptop. The laptop would only give a control access over those machines and you can train freely without overheating your laptop üòé\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are frequently using your laptop for deep learning outside of your place (or office), desktop will not help. If on top of this, internet access is not always stable (in the train), cloud GPU will not be accessible. It‚Äôs up to you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to size my GPU\n\n\n\n\n\nModern GPUs (NVIDIA RTX 20 or 30 series) leverage FP16 training to train models twice as big by giving up a bit of float precision.\nSo, estimate your VRAM needs first. It depends both on the type of task and the model size. In computer vision for instance, image classification, object detection and segmentation have enough model options to fit on a 6Gb VRAM in FP16. Investigate a bit the default VRAM needed for your specific tasks.\nThen it‚Äôs all a matter of cores (both the count and their generation): there are Ray Tracing (RT) cores, Tensor cores and CUDA cores. For deep learning, you‚Äôre only interested in the last two."

Thanks to this review, I ruled out Acer Nitro 5 & Acer Helios (GPU, RAM & screen quality), and the MSI GF66 (terrible battery).\nWhich left me with (presumably already very good options):\n\nDell G15 5520\nLenovo Legion 5i\n\n\n\nFinal showdown\nEspecially when two laptops are similar, there is a high probability that a detailed comparison video exists!\n\nComparison takeaways:\n\n165Hz is much better\nwifi much faster on G15\nbattery better on G15\nsimilar in terms of GPU perf\nboth very good laptops\nthose are AMD Ryzen versions, so we‚Äôll have to compare the Intel CPUs ourselves\n\nLet‚Äôs gather up all the important information and add the CPU Mark using online benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\nDell G15 5520\nLenovo Legion 5i (6th gen)\nLenovo Legion 5i (7th gen)\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n1499‚Ç¨\n1399‚Ç¨\n1499‚Ç¨\n\n\nCPU\nIntel Core i7 12700H\nIntel Core i7 11800H\nIntel Core i5 12500H\n\n\nCPU Mark\n27642\n21317\n23224\n\n\nGPU\nNVIDIA RTX 3060\nNVIDIA RTX 3060\nNVIDIA RTX 3060\n\n\nScreen\nFHD, 165Hz\nFHD, 120Hz\nFHD, 165Hz\n\n\nStorage\nSSD, 512Go\nSSD, 512Go\nSSD, 512Go\n\n\nRAM\n16Go, 4800MHz, dual channel\n16Go, 3200Mhz, single channel\n16Go, 4800Mhz, dual channel\n\n\nWifi\n11ax\n11ax\n11ac\n\n\nBattery\n86Wh (6 cells)\n60Wh (4 cells)\n80Wh (4 cells)\n\n\nWeight\n2.6kg\n2.4kg\n2.4kg\n\n\n\nThe screen refresh rate, RAM and battery rule out the Lenovo 6th gen. And on the remaining specs that differ between the two contenders (CPU Mark, wifi, battery), the Dell G15 is superior, so that will be my pick!\n\n\nConfirm the choice\nLet‚Äôs run down the checklist:\n\nDell is an established & reputed laptop manufacturers, and the reviews are excellent\nthe CPU is actually the best mobile CPU on the market at the moment ü•á (May 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Intel Core 11th and 12th gen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed the difference in CPU Mark between the i7 11800H (11th gen) and i5 12500H (12th gen), which is only an i5. With their new generation of CPUs, Intel is aiming at power efficiency. Remember the physical cores of the CPU? Now your chip will onboard two types: P-cores (performance), and E-cores (efficiency). The appropriate core type will be selected dynamically to get you the best performance/battery life balance.\n\n\n\n\nthe GPU is among the best ranked mobile GPUs ü•â\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare with your previous laptop\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of safety, I compared the performances of this GPU with my last professional laptop, a Razer Blade 15, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max Q. It outperforms it by 8-12% on all aspects, while the price being much lower (1499‚Ç¨ for the Dell G15, while the Razer Blade was 2200‚Ç¨ at the end of 2020 when it was purchased). I did the comparison because performance-wise, I was very happy with that previous laptop.\n\n\n\n\nlet‚Äôs check a few laptop reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview takeaways:\n\nSSD & RAM are upgradeable\nvery good value for money in terms of perf thanks to 12th gen Intel CPU\nvery good screen quality\nincredible battery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview takeaways:\n\nthe laptop is a bit heavy\nvery nice screen\ngood keyboard\nbest battery on the market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to upgrade the SSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced note: MUX Switch\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this is a concept I discovered while benchmarking a few weeks back, quite an interesting one, especially if you‚Äôre using your laptop for Gaming!\n\nLaptops may or may not have a MUX switch, which a feature that can bypass the iGPU when data flows from the dGPU to your screen. What does that mean?\n\nMUX Switch ON: data processed on dGPU, then directly displayed on screen.\nMUX Switch OFF: data processed on dGPU, then processed by iGPU, then displayed on screen.\n\nHaving a MUX switch gives you the choice. But when it‚Äôs on, you get better FPS in games, at the cost of higher power/battery consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo red flags, so the choice is confirmed üöÄ\nNote: I checked second-hand platforms (Backmarket), but unfortunately, this model wasn‚Äôt available. After a few Google searches, I ended up buying it on the manufacturer website because there was no price difference."

When you put your laptop on cloth for instance, as it‚Äôs partially obstructed, your fan will speed up even more üå°Ô∏è This has two consequences:\n\nreducing the life of your fans: they will operate much faster than without obstruction, for the same usage.\nendangering internal components: if the temperature gets too high, that will degrade hardware components prematurely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you do for this?\n\nconsider purchasing a laptop stand (or at least not obstructing the fans on a regular basis): the laptop will last longer, and your neck will thank you for it.\nclean it once in a while: it‚Äôs inevitable that dust will get in the way of your air entries at some point. Check online how to safely clean your fans.\n\n\n\nA good night sleep for everyone\nWhen you go to bed, consider shutting down your laptop instead of clapping it/putting it to sleep üò¥ Simply put, while in sleep mode, your hardware is solicited more than when shut down (remember, it‚Äôs not shut down so the RAM is loaded with data among others). If you put it to sleep, that will reduce its life expectancy.\n\n\nMinimizing the number of charge cycles\nSome people say that leaving it plugged won‚Äôt damage the battery well-being (same debate with smartphones), some say the opposite. I am no expert in charger and laptop battery manufacturing, but why take the risk?\nWhen plugged, you solicit:\n\nyour laptop charger\nyour laptop battery\n\nAs a rule of thumb, since we don‚Äôt know for sure, if you don‚Äôt need maximum performances and have a lot of battery, unplug your charger üëç"
